# nb2md: conversion of Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks to Jupyter or Markdown formats

The `nb2md` tool builds on top of [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) and lets you convert both Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks to Markdown.

## Installation

You can install the package with pip:

```
pip install nb2md
```

## Usage

The format of input notebooks can be either Jupyter or Zeppelin.
The format of output notebooks can be either Jupyter or Markdown.
Input and output formats are guessed by the extension of the pathname base name: `.ipynb` for Jupyter, `.json` for Zeppelin and `.md` for Markdown.

To convert a Zeppelin notebook to Markdown:

```
nb2md --src notebooks/example1.json --dst example1.md
```
To convert a Zeppelin notebook to Markdown, using the notebook name to form the destination pathname:

```
nb2md --src notebooks/example1.json
```

To convert a Zeppelin notebook hosted on AWS S3:

```
nb2md --src s3://bucketname/your/path/2E6XDUATX/note.json
```


To convert a Jupyter notebook to Markdown:

```
nb2md --src notebooks/example2.ipynb --dst example2.md
```

To convert a Zeppelin notebook to the Jupyter format:

```
nb2md --src notebooks/example1.json --dst example1.ipynb
```

## Development

Tests, builds and releases are managed with `Fabric`.
You also need the `wheel` package. To install them:

```
pip install wheel Fabric3
```

### Building and publishing a new release

Create a file `secrets.py` in the project directory with the Pypi credentials in this format:

```
pypi_auth = {
    'user': 'youruser',
    'pass': 'yourpass'
}
```

To release a new version:

```
fab release
```


### Running the tests

To run the py.test tests:

```
fab test
```

To run a single test:

```
fab test:tests/test_pep8.py::test_pep8
```

To run tests printing output and stopping at first error:

```
fab test_sx
```

To run the pep8 test:

```
fab test_pep8
```

To fix some common pep8 errors in the code:

```
fab fix_pep8
```
